```
@apps/web/src/routes/_public/updates/posts write a changelog for the present day, it should have a tone similar to previous posts, where it's markety/salesly but not much. It should present features in a concise way but focusing on the value they provide for the user/organization rather than on what it does.

look at git commits spanning from today's date til the last changelog date for context on what have changed.

pick major features and create headings for them in a structured way (look at existing posts to better understand how it's done)

leave placeholder for images with visual descriptions of what we should put there (don't worry about the description text because it's going to be deleted once we add the image)

group small features and bug fixes into the "Other Improvements" section
```
