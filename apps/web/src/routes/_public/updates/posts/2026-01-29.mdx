# AI-Powered Status Suggestions

Support Intelligence just got smarter. FrontDesk now analyzes your thread conversations and suggests the right status change at the right time, helping your team stay on top of their workflow without the manual overhead.

## How It Works

When a customer confirms their issue is fixed, or when a conversation naturally reaches resolution, FrontDesk's AI recognizes these patterns and surfaces a status suggestion. Each recommendation comes with context explaining *why* the status change makes sense, so your team can make informed decisions with a single click.

## Accept or Dismiss Instantly

Suggestions appear right in your thread view. Accept with one click to update the status and log the change in your thread timeline, or dismiss if the timing isn't right. Either way, FrontDesk learns and adapts to how your team operates.

# Slack History Import

Connecting Slack to FrontDesk is now even more powerful. The new backfill feature lets you import historical messages from your configured Slack channels, so you don't lose valuable context when setting up your support workspace.

Your team can start with full visibility into past conversations rather than starting from scratch. All imported messages sync properly with replies, threading, and author information intact.

# Other Improvements

- **Faster Event Logs**: Thread activity logs now use virtualized rendering, delivering smooth scrolling performance even with hundreds of events. Your longest threads will load and scroll just as fast as your shortest.
- **Smarter Suggestion Grouping**: Label and status suggestions are now grouped more intuitively, with better tracking of which suggestions you've already acted on.
- **Dependency Updates**: Security and stability improvements through updated dependencies for Express and other core packages.
