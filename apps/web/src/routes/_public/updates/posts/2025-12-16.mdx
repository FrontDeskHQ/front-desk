# Public Support Portal Overhaul

The support portal just got a major upgrade. What was once a simple way to view threads has evolved into a complete customer support experience — your customers can now create new conversations, reply to existing ones, and track everything in a redesigned interface.

## Creating Threads

Your customers no longer need to rely on external channels to reach you. Directly from your public support portal, they can now start a new conversation with full context — title, description, and any relevant details. The thread creation experience is clean and focused, designed to reduce friction and help customers get the help they need faster.

Combined with the new in-portal authentication system, returning customers stay logged in and can pick up right where they left off. No more juggling email links or losing track of past conversations.

## Replying to Threads

Conversations are now two-way. Customers can reply to threads directly from the portal, keeping the entire discussion in one place. Every reply syncs instantly with your FrontDesk inbox and any connected integrations like Discord, so your whole community and team always remain connected.

## New Design

We've completely redesigned the portal layout to feel more intuitive and easy to use. A refreshed navbar with dynamic link indicators makes navigation clearer, pagination controls let customers browse through their threads at their own pace, and the overall visual hierarchy has been refined to put content front and center.

The portal footer now includes quick links to your community and resources, and status updates are now visible directly on threads — so customers can see when something has changed without needing to ask.

## Labels

![Labels in the properties sidebar](TO BE ADDED)

Organize your support threads with labels. Create custom labels in your workspace settings, assign them to threads, and filter your inbox to focus on what matters. Labels appear throughout the app — in thread lists, thread details, and the properties sidebar — with consistent, color-coded badges.

## Status Updates

![Status updates in the timeline](TO BE ADDED)

Threads now track status changes as updates — every time a thread moves from open to in progress, or gets resolved, it's logged and visible. Your team can see the full history in the internal thread view, and customers can follow along on the public portal. No more wondering what happened or when — the timeline tells the story.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

For power users who prefer to keep their hands on the keyboard, we've introduced keybinds throughout the app. Navigate between threads, update properties, and manage your inbox without reaching for the mouse. Input fields are automatically isolated, so shortcuts won't interfere while you're typing.

## Other Improvements

- **Discord Portal Links**: When a thread is created through Discord, we now send a direct link to the portal thread — making it easy for customers to continue the conversation in either place.
- **Improved Onboarding**: New users are now prompted to enable integrations during setup, helping teams get connected from day one.
- **Better Billing**: Subscription and seat management has been simplified under the hood for a smoother experience.
- **Enhanced Security**: Portal authentication now uses proper CSRF protection for safer customer sessions.
