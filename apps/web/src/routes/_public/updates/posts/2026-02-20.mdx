# Knowledge Base Integration

Give your AI smarter context by connecting your documentation. FrontDesk now crawls your existing docs, help articles, and guides—then uses that knowledge to provide more accurate suggestions and better support responses.

## Connect Your Documentation

Point FrontDesk at your documentation site, and it handles the rest. The crawler reads your sitemap, fetches your content, and indexes everything for AI-powered search. Whether you use GitBook, Mintlify, Docusaurus, or any static docs site, the setup takes seconds.

## Smarter AI Responses

With your documentation indexed, FrontDesk's AI can reference your actual product knowledge when helping customers. Instead of generic responses, your team gets suggestions grounded in your specific docs, reducing time spent searching for answers and improving response quality.

## Real-Time Sync

Documentation changes? FrontDesk keeps up. Re-crawl sources anytime to pull in updates, and track exactly how many pages and chunks are indexed for each source. Status indicators show you the health of each connection at a glance.
