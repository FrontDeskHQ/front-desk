# Introducing Support Intelligence

Your support conversations now come with a built-in assistant. Support Intelligence analyzes every thread in real-time and surfaces actionable suggestions—helping you stay organized, respond faster, and keep your queue moving.

{/* Screenshot should show: The Support Intelligence section in the thread input area with both a status suggestion and label suggestions visible */}

## Automatic Status Suggestions

Let AI handle the routine decisions. Support Intelligence reads the full conversation context and suggests when a thread's status should change—whether a customer confirmed a fix, abandoned a request, or needs follow-up.

{/* Screenshot should show: A status suggestion chip with "Closed" status and the hover card showing reasoning like "The customer confirmed the solution works" */}

Hover over any suggestion to see exactly why it was recommended. No black-box AI here—you'll always understand the reasoning before you act. Accept with a single click, or dismiss if you disagree. Either way, you stay in control.

## Smart Label Suggestions

Stop manually tagging every conversation. Support Intelligence reviews your thread content and suggests the most relevant labels from your workspace, so categorization happens automatically.

Each suggestion is based on the actual conversation—not just keywords. Accept individual labels, apply them all at once, or dismiss what doesn't fit. Your labels, your rules.

## One-Click Bulk Actions

When the suggestions are spot-on, skip the clicks. Accept all suggestions at once with a single action, or dismiss everything just as easily. The interface stays clean and focused on what matters—your customers.

# Other Improvements

- **Improved Suggestion UI**: The suggestion interface has been refined with hover cards that provide detailed reasoning and one-click accept buttons for faster triage.
- **Better Conversation Analysis**: The AI now considers the full conversation history and thread context, not just the latest message, for more accurate suggestions.
- **Analytics Tracking**: Support Intelligence now tracks suggestion interactions, helping you understand how the feature improves your workflow over time.
