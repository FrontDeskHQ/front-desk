# Signals

Support Intelligence now has a home. The new Signals page brings all AI-powered insights into one place: a feed where your team can review suggestions, spot patterns, and take action on what matters most.

Instead of hunting through individual threads for recommendations, Signals surfaces everything in a single view. Status changes, duplicate threads, and other AI suggestions are organized and ready for review. Your team spends less time searching and more time resolving.

# Duplicate Thread Detection

Customers sometimes open the same issue twice, or different customers run into the same problem. FrontDesk now automatically identifies potential duplicates and surfaces them as suggestions, helping your team consolidate conversations and avoid duplicate effort.

When a new thread closely matches an existing one, you'll see a suggestion with context explaining the connection. Review the match, merge the conversations if appropriate, and keep your inbox clean. The result: faster responses, consistent answers, and less confusion for everyone involved.

# Thread Backfill

Already have active support conversations in Discord or Slack? FrontDesk can now import your existing threads from connected channels, so you don't have to start from scratch.

When you connect a new channel, existing conversations are automatically imported into FrontDesk. Your team gets immediate visibility into ongoing issues, and customers don't have to repeat themselves. Seamlessly upgrade your existing communities.

# Guided Onboarding

Getting started with FrontDesk is now easier than ever. A new step-by-step checklist guides you through setup: connecting integrations, creating labels, inviting team members, and resolving your first thread.

Each step includes clear instructions and links directly to the relevant location in the app. Progress is tracked automatically, so you always know what's next.

# Other Improvements

- **Redesigned Landing Page**: A new interactive product demo showcases FrontDesk in action, giving visitors a real feel for the experience before signing up.
- **Integration Health Alerts**: Warnings now appear when your Discord, Slack, or GitHub integrations need attention — missing permissions, expired tokens, or configuration issues surface before they become problems.
- **Status Indicator Refresh**: Status badges throughout the app have been refined with cleaner styling and improved visual hierarchy.
- **Thread Chips**: A new component for displaying linked threads makes it easier to see relationships between conversations at a glance.
- **Performance Improvements**: Command palette and context registration are now memoized for snappier interactions, and event logs use virtualized rendering for smoother scrolling.
