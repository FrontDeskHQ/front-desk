# GitHub Integration

Bring your support conversations and development workflow closer together. FrontDesk now connects directly with your GitHub repositories, letting you create issues, link pull requests, and keep status in sync, all without leaving your inbox.

## Create Issues from Threads

Turn customer conversations into actionable work. When a thread needs engineering attention, create a GitHub issue directly from FrontDesk. The issue stays linked to the original thread, so context is never lost and your team always knows where a request came from.

## Link Pull Requests

Track progress from customer issues to fixes. Link pull requests to threads and see development status right alongside customer conversations. When a PR lands, everyone involved, from customers to support and engineering, stays in the loop.

## Status Sync

Keep both sides of your workflow aligned. When an issue is closed on GitHub, the linked thread updates automatically. No manual status changes, no forgotten follow-ups, just smooth handoffs from code to customer.

# Slack Integration

Meet your customers where they already are. The new Slack integration brings FrontDesk into your Slack workspace, syncing threads and replies in real-time.

Set up a dedicated Slack channel for support threads, and every new conversation flows into FrontDesk. Replies sync both ways, respond from FrontDesk or Slack, and the conversation stays unified. Your team can collaborate naturally without switching tools.

# Other Improvements

- **Discord Mentions**: Messages from Discord now properly display user, role, and channel mentions, no more raw IDs cluttering your threads.
- **Portal Link Toggles**: Choose whether to send portal links when new threads are created in Discord or Slack, giving you control over how customers interact with your support.
- **Smarter Avatars**: When team members reply through Discord or Slack, their profile pictures now appear alongside messages for a more personal touch.
- **UI Refinements**: Buttons, dialogs, and comboboxes have been polished for a smoother, more consistent experience throughout the app.
- **Performance Improvements**: GitHub data caching and improved fetch logic mean faster load times when working with issues and pull requests.
