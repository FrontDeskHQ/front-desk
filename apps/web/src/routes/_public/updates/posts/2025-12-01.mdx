# Introducing the FrontDesk Widget

We're excited to announce the FrontDesk Widget — a powerful way to bring customer support directly into your application. Your customers can now create threads, view their conversation history, and get real-time updates without ever leaving your product.

You can also add resource links to guide your customers — point them to documentation, FAQs, or your community. Resources can open external links or display custom content directly inside the widget, giving you flexibility to surface help before a conversation even starts.

The widget is fully customizable, mobile-responsive, and works seamlessly with your existing FrontDesk setup. Simply install the `@front-desk/widget` package, add your public API key, and you're ready to go. Check out our [widget documentation](/docs/integrations/widget) to get started.

# Thread Deletion & Archive

A new moderation tool to keep your support queue focused on what matters. Delete spam, test messages, or conversations that shouldn't have been created in the first place. Deleted threads are moved to a dedicated archive for 30 days, where you can review or restore them if needed.

# Other Improvements

- **API Key Management**: A brand new API Keys screen in organization settings makes it easy to create and manage your integration keys.
- **Enhanced Public Portal**: Thread properties are now visible on the public support portal, giving your customers more context about their requests.
- **Better Page Titles**: Improved page titles across the app for easier navigation and better browser tab management.
- **Account Controls**: New logout buttons and email display in onboarding forms for a smoother user experience.
- **SEO Enhancements**: We've added sitemap support to improve discoverability.
- **Documentation**: New docs covering API keys and widget setup are now available.
