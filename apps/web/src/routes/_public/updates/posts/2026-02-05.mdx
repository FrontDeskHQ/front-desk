# Meet Signal: Your AI-Powered Triage Assistant

Stop manually reviewing every thread to decide what needs attention. Signal is a new dedicated dashboard that surfaces AI-generated suggestions for your entire support queue, letting you resolve threads and mark duplicates with a single click.

When threads come in, FrontDesk analyzes them in the background. It reads the content, checks your history for similar conversations, and determines whether a thread should be resolved or if it's a duplicate of an existing issue. Signal collects all these suggestions in one place so you can triage your inbox in bulk instead of one thread at a time.

## Batch Actions

Process multiple suggestions at once. When Signal groups related suggestions together, you can accept or dismiss them all with a single action. Clear through backlogs faster and keep your inbox focused on what actually needs your attention.

## Duplicate Detection

No more hunting for related threads yourself. When FrontDesk detects that a new thread is asking the same question as an existing one, it surfaces a duplicate suggestion with the original thread linked. Accept the suggestion and the new thread is automatically marked as a duplicate, keeping your support queue clean and your metrics accurate.

# In-Thread AI Suggestions

The same intelligence that powers Signal is now available right where you work. When viewing a thread, you'll see AI-generated suggestions for labels, status changes, and duplicates directly in the thread input area.

## Smart Labels

As you view a thread, FrontDesk suggests relevant labels based on the conversation content. Click to apply a label instantly, or dismiss suggestions that don't fit. Labels stay in sync across the thread and your inbox view.

## Status Recommendations

When a thread looks resolved based on the conversation history, FrontDesk surfaces a status suggestion. One click marks the thread as resolved and logs the change in the timeline. Your customers see the update in the portal, and your team knows the issue is handled.

## Duplicate Linking

If FrontDesk finds a thread that looks like a duplicate, you'll see a linked thread chip with hover details. Accept the suggestion to mark the current thread as a duplicate and automatically link it to the original conversation.
