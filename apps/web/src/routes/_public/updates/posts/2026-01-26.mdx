# AI-Powered Status Suggestions

Support Intelligence just got smarter. FrontDesk now analyzes your thread conversations and suggests the right status change at the right time, helping your team stay on top of their workflow without the manual overhead.

When a customer confirms their issue is fixed, or when a conversation naturally reaches resolution, FrontDesk's AI recognizes these patterns and surfaces a status suggestion. Each recommendation comes with context explaining _why_ the status change makes sense, so your team can make informed decisions with a single click.

# Other Improvements

- **Faster Event Logs**: Thread activity logs now use virtualized rendering, delivering smooth scrolling performance even with hundreds of events. Your longest threads will load and scroll just as fast as your shortest.
- **Smarter Suggestion Grouping**: Label and status suggestions are now grouped more intuitively, with better tracking of which suggestions you've already acted on.
- **Dependency Updates**: Security and stability improvements through updated dependencies for Express and other core packages.
