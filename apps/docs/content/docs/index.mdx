FrontDesk is an open-source customer support platform designed to help you assist your customers wherever they are. Built with design as a first-class citizen, it provides a seamless and lightning-fast experience for both support teams and customers.

## Core philosophy

FrontDesk is built on three fundamental principles that transform how you think about customer support:

### Public support as first-class citizen

Transparency builds trust. When companies make their support conversations public, customers can see the quality of support they're receiving before they even reach out. This openness demonstrates confidence in your service and creates accountability. Every resolved thread becomes a testament to your commitment to customer success—visible, searchable, and authentic.

### Meet customers where they already are

Customer support should never be a barrier. When someone needs help, they're already experiencing friction—don't add another obstacle by forcing them to navigate unfamiliar channels or fill out complex forms. FrontDesk integrates seamlessly with the platforms your customers already use, whether that's Discord, email, or your website. Support should be as effortless as asking a friend for help.

### Extract value from every conversation

Getting customers to articulate what they truly want is difficult. But in support conversations, they do it naturally—sharing pain points, use cases, and feature requests with genuine detail. Don't let this invaluable feedback disappear into a private inbox. FrontDesk transforms every support thread into actionable insights, helping you understand your customers better and build products they actually need.

## Key features
