### Frequently Asked Questions

#### Is there a free trial?

Yes! When you create an organization, you'll automatically get a 14-day free trial.

#### Can I upgrade or downgrade my plan at any time?

Absolutely! You can upgrade or downgrade your plan at any time. Changes take effect immediately, and you'll be charged or credited on a prorated basis.

#### What happens if I exceed my plan limits?

If you're on the Starter plan and need more than 2 support channels, you'll need to upgrade to Pro. For all other limits (tickets, customers), there are no restrictions—you can handle unlimited volume on any plan.

#### How does billing work?

Billing is per seat, per month. You're charged for each team member who has access to your FrontDesk workspace. Seats can be added or removed at any time, and billing adjusts automatically.

#### What payment methods do you accept?

We accept all major credit cards. Enterprise customers can arrange for invoice-based billing—contact us for details.
