Integrations connect your support channels to FrontDesk, allowing you to manage all customer conversations from a single unified inbox. When customers reach out through connected channels, their messages automatically sync to FrontDesk in real-time.

To configure integrations for your organization:

1. Go to Organization Settings → Integrations
2. Select the integration you want to set up
3. Follow the setup instructions for that integration
