title: Discord Integration

Connect your Discord server to FrontDesk and manage support conversations directly from Discord threads. When users create threads in your Discord support channels, they automatically sync to FrontDesk in real-time.

## How it works

When a user creates a thread in a Discord channel you've configured for support, it automatically syncs to FrontDesk. Messages sent on Discord appear instantly in FrontDesk, and replies from your support team in FrontDesk post back to the Discord thread.

## Setting up Discord

1. Go to Organization Settings → Integrations
2. Find **Discord** in the integrations list
3. Click **Enable Discord** or **Configure Discord**
4. Select your Discord server and authorize the bot
5. Select which channels should be monitored for support threads

Only threads created in selected channels will sync to FrontDesk.

## Managing Discord threads

Once threads are synced, you can manage them just like any other FrontDesk thread. Update status, set priority, assign team members — all changes sync back to Discord automatically.
