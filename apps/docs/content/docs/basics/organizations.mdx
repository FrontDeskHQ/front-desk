Think of an organization as a company workspace within FrontDesk, where your team collaborates on support. This are their characteristics:

- **A workspace**: Where your team collaborates on support
- **A billing entity**: Each organization has its own subscription and billing
- **A domain**: Organizations can have custom subdomains for their support portal
- **An isolation boundary**: Data, users, and settings are separate between organizations

A user can be a member of multiple organizations and switch between them easily.

## Creating an organization

Upon signing up, you'll be prompted to create your first organization.

To create additional organizations:

1. Click your organization switcher in the sidebar
2. Select "Create New Organization"
3. Enter organization details

## Organization settings

### Basic information

- **Name**: Your organization's display name
- **Slug**: The slug is the URL-friendly identifier for your organization. It's used to access your support portal and workspace. (e.g., "acme" → `acme.tryfrontdesk.app`)
- **Logo**: Upload a logo that appears in your support portal and workspace

### Support porta

## Managing members

Member management is done in the "Members" section of the organization settings.
Members can have two different roles:

- **Owner**: Full access to all settings, billing, and members

Invited members receive an email with a link to join your organization.

  and joins your organization. You can manage active members and billing at any
  time from your organization settings.
