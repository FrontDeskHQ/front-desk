title: Threads
---

Threads are the core of FrontDesk — they represent individual support conversations with your customers. Each thread contains messages and can be organized with status, priority, and assignments.

## Creating threads

Threads originate from your support channels integrations. When a user reaches out in a channel you've configured for support, it will automatically be synced to FrontDesk.

Check out the [integrations](/integrations) page to see all the channels you can connect to.

## Managing threads

### Viewing threads

Threads appear in your main inbox view, where you can filter by status, priority, assignee and more.

### Thread status

- **Open**: New thread awaiting response
- **In Progress**: Being actively worked on
- **Resolved**: Issue has been resolved
- **Closed**: Thread is closed (no further action needed)

### Priority levels

- **No priority**: No priority (default)
- **Low**: Non-urgent requests
- **Medium**: Standard priority
- **High**: Important issues requiring attention
- **Urgent**: Critical issues needing immediate response

### Assigning threads

Assign the support agent that will be responsible for the thread.

## Public threads

One of FrontDesk's unique features is that threads are **public by default**. This means:

- **SEO**: Search engines can index your support content
- **Self-service**: Customers can find answers without contacting support
- **Transparency**: Builds trust through open communication
- **Knowledge base**: Resolved threads become searchable resources

Your public threads are accessible through your organization's support portal. Customers can browse, search, and read all public threads, making it easy for them to find answers to common questions.
