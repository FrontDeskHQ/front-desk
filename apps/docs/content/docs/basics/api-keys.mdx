title: API keys

API keys allow you to authenticate and interact with the FrontDesk API programmatically. Use them to create threads, manage conversations, and integrate FrontDesk into your applications.

## Creating API keys

Only organization owners can create API keys. To create a new API key:

1. Go to **Organization Settings** → **API Keys**
2. Click **New API key**
3. Enter a descriptive name for your API key (e.g., "Production API", "Development", "Mobile App")
4. Click **Create**

<Callout type="warning" title="Copy your key immediately">
  After creating an API key, you'll see it displayed **only once**. Make sure to
  copy it immediately and store it securely. You won't be able to view the key
  again after closing the dialog.
</Callout>

API keys are prefixed with `fd_pk_` and are long, randomly generated strings. They expire after one year by default, but you can set a custom expiration date when creating them programmatically.

## Revoking API keys

If an API key is compromised or no longer needed, you should revoke it immediately:

1. Go to **Organization Settings** → **API Keys**
2. Find the API key you want to revoke
3. Click the trash icon next to the key
4. Confirm the revocation

<Callout type="warning" title="Immediate effect">
  Revoking an API key takes effect immediately. Any applications using that key
  will stop working right away. Make sure to update your applications with a new
  key before revoking the old one.
</Callout>

Revoked API keys cannot be restored. You'll need to create a new API key if you need to restore access.

## Best practices

### Security

- **Never commit API keys to version control**: Store them in environment variables or secure secret management systems
- **Use different keys for different environments**: Create separate keys for development, staging, and production
- **Rotate keys regularly**: Create new keys periodically and revoke old ones
- **Use descriptive names**: Name your keys clearly so you can identify their purpose (e.g., "Production Web App", "Mobile App v2")
- **Monitor key usage**: Keep track of which applications use which keys

### Organization

- **Limit the number of active keys**: Only keep keys that are actively in use
- **Document key purposes**: Use the name field to document what each key is used for
- **Set expiration dates**: For keys with known lifespans, set appropriate expiration dates
- **Revoke unused keys**: Regularly audit and revoke keys that are no longer needed

### Implementation

- **Store keys securely**: Use environment variables or secure vaults, never hardcode them
- **Use HTTPS**: Always make API requests over HTTPS to protect your keys in transit
- **Implement error handling**: Handle authentication errors gracefully in your applications
- **Test with separate keys**: Use different keys for testing to avoid affecting production

## Using API keys

API keys are used to authenticate requests to the FrontDesk API. Include your API key in the `Authorization` header of your requests:

```
Authorization: Bearer fd_pk_your_api_key_here
```
